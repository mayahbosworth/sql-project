Kharonâ€™s core mission involves managing and mitigating risks associated with global financial transactions. I selected this job because it aligns with my passion for using data to solve complex problems, particularly in the area of security. This position is directly aligned with my career objectives of becoming a data engineer. I am deeply interested in this job because it offers the chance to work on meaningful projects that not only require high technical proficiency but also have a significant impact on global business integrity and security.

The problem is well-suited for SQL given its capabilities for managing and querying large datasets. Tableau will enable the clear presentation of complex data, making the insights accessible to stakeholders.
